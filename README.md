# Air-Pollutant (PM2.5)-Prediction - using R
PM2.5-a Fine particulate matter is an air pollutant that is a concern for people's health when levels in air are high.
# Problem Statment 
In Delhi and nearby cities, the air quality is very bad. So, the ask is to predict the air pollutant prediction (PM2.5) based on air constituents like SO2, NO2 , CO quantity, temperature and weather for RK-Puram City
# Approach
The outlier and missing value were taken care as the data contains them in abundance
Normality of the variables are tested and important variables are taken for final model
Ouput transformation (Log) is also done to improve the model performance
Final Linear Regression is used to predict the outcome
Evaluation Metrics- RMSE and MAE
